ABOUT
====================================

The htmLawed module uses the htmLawed PHP library (www.bioinformatics.org/phplabware/internal_utilities/htmLawed) to restrict and purify HTML for compliance with admin. policy and standards and for security.

The module's directory includes the htmLawed PHP library and htmLawed documentation in its 'htmLawed' sub-directory. The content of the sub-directory can be replaced with that for the latest htmLawed version from www.bioinformatics.org/phplabware/internal_utilities/htmLawed.

If the htmLawed library that has been installed through the Libraries Drupal module, then the htmLawed module will use that library.

The Drupal website may have a handbook and other pages detailing htmLawed module usage (http://drupal.org/node/255886 and https://www.drupal.org/search/site/htmlawed?f[0]=ss_meta_type%3Adocumentation).

INSTALLATION
====================================

Place the htmLawed module directory ('htmlawed') in an appropriate location within the Drupal installation directory, such as within its 'modules' directory.

Then administer your Drupal website to enable the module.

If the htmLawed library that has been installed through the Libraries Drupal module, then the htmLawed module will use that library.

USAGE
====================================

To enable and/or configure the htmLawed filter, such as for a text format, visit the text formats section of your Drupal website and configure the text format that will use or uses the filter.

More than one text format can use the filter, each configured with its own settings for the filter. The htmLawed filter is configured by providing values in the form for its settings. The 'Config.' form-field is filled with comma-separated, quoted, key-value pairs like:

'safe'=>1, 'element'=>'a, em, strong'

(These are interpreted as PHP array elements).

The 'Spec.' form-field is an optional string of unquoted text. See the htmLawed documentation for more on how 'Config.' and 'Spec.' can be set, for instance, to permit all HTML, or restrict links to only certain domains. The default htmLawed filter settings allow the use of the a, em, strong, cite, code, ol, ul, li, dl, dt, dd, br and p HTML tags, and deny the id and style HTML attributes, and any unsafe markup (such as the the scriptable onclick attribute).

Content in the 'Short tip' and 'Long tip' form-fields are used to inform users about the filter, such as about the tags that are allowed.

To allow HTML comments such as the one used for the Drupal teaser-break indicator (<!--break-->), add "'comment' => 2" to the 'Config.' value of the htmLawed settings. To allow PHP codes (flanked by '<?php' and '?>') add "'save_php' => 1" to the 'Config.' value of the htmLawed settings.

Depending on the types of other filters in use, you may need to re-arrange the processing order of filters. The htmLawed filter would usually be the last filter to be run. If a filter generates HTML markup and is run before htmLawed, then htmLawed should be configured appropriately to permit such markup.

Any in-built Drupal actions/filters to restrict HTML, correct broken HTML, or balance or properly nest HTML tags can be disabled since htmLawed performs these tasks. The htmLawed filter can also be used to restrict HTML attributes, limit URL protocols, etc. Note that htmLawed does not convert URLs into links nor does it convert line breaks into HTML.

It is important to understand the security implications of the htmLawed settings in use and the limitations of htmLawed. To keep the htmLawed library included with the module updated, replace the 'htmLawed.php' and 'htmLawed_README.htm' files inside the 'htmLawed' sub-directory of the htmLawed module directory ('htmlawed') with newer versions downloaded from the htmLawed website (www.bioinformatics.org/phplabware/internal_utilities/htmLawed). If the htmLawed library is being used through the Libraries Drupal module, use that module to update the library.
