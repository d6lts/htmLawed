About htmLawed
==========================

  htmLawed is a highly customizable single-file PHP script to make text secure, and standard- and admin policy-compliant for use in the body of HTML 4, XHTML 1 or 1.1, or generic XML documents. It is thus a configurable input (X)HTML filter, processor, purifier, sanitizer, beautifier, etc., and an alternative to the HTMLTidy application.

  The lawing in of input text is needed to ensure that HTML code in the text is standard-compliant, does not introduce security vulnerabilities, and does not break the aesthetics, design or layout of web-pages. htmLawed tries to do this by, for example, making HTML well-formed with balanced and properly nested tags, neutralizing code that may be used for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, and allowing only specified HTML elements/tags and attributes.
